## Welcome

Welcome to this set of tutorials focused on providing a structured learning approach. Through these tutorials you will not only learn the fundamental analytic applications, but you will also apply and perform knowledge checks as you progress through the tutorials. This is accomplished through:

1. Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations.
2. Code exercises (R code chunks that you can edit and execute directly).
3. Knowledge check (aka quiz) questions.

This initial tutorial is meant to assess the functionality of your computer setup. First, your tutorial should be organized with a floating table of contents to the left of the content as in the below image.  If this is not the case and your table of contents overlaps the narrative content then you need to update your `rmarkdown` package to the latest version.

## System Requirements

The following outlines system requirements to make sure these tutorials operate correctly:

- [R v3.4.0 (2017-04-21) or greater](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio v1.0.143 or greater](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Internet connection
- These tutorials depend on the following packages.  These all should have been installed when you downloaded this package; however, you might want to confirm that they all downloaded successfully.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pkgs <- c("learnr", "tidyverse", "moments", "outliers", "GGally", "cluster",
          "factoextra", "ISLR", "car", "caret", "MASS", "ROCR", "gridExtra",
          "grid", "pscl", "boot", "leaps", "ggplot2movies")

install.packages(pkgs)
```


## Equation Display

Throughout many tutorials you will see mathematical notation.  The equations leverage mathjax and you should see them in equation form (i.e. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$).  However, if the equation is showing up looking like LaTex code (i.e. Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon) then your mathjax conversion is not happening correctly. If this is the case, do the following:  

1. Ensure you are connected to the internet.  
2. If it continues try a different browser such as Google Chrome (I've had some problems with MathJax rendering successfully in Safari).
3. If it still is a problem please report an issue [here](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/learningAnalytics/issues) (be sure to include specifics about your operating system and software versions).

## Running Code

Throughout these tutorials you will be able to execute code as you progress. The following illustrates the code environment you will have. Go ahead and change the below code so it computes 2 + 2:
    
```{r addition, exercise=TRUE}
1 + 1
```


## Knowledge Checks

You will also see Knowledge Checks along the way where you will be able to answer questions.  These look like the following:

```{r test, echo=FALSE}
question("Do you love R?",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
  answer("No"),
  correct = "Fantastic choice! You automatically get 5 brownie points!",
  incorrect = "Ummmm...why are you here???"
)
```


## HTML Tables

Data frame outputs are often converted to HTML tables.  Depending on your browser, these tables may not initially appear (however you will see a table outline where the table would be).  If this happens just refresh your browser and the table should generate.

```{r}
mtcars
```

## Reporting Problems

If you continue to have persistent problems that you cannot resolve please do not hestitate to report the issue at  [https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/learningAnalytics/issues](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/learningAnalytics/issues).

Thanks and I hope you enjoy the tutorials!  
Brad
